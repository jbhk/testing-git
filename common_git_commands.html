    Common git commands I use:

    1. git pull - get code from a repository
    2. git add .
       git commit -m "message"
       or
       git commit -a -m "message"
    3. Then type
       git push
       And then type your login to github

    miscellaneous
    Show diff between what you have changed and what is on origin and your master branch
    git diff --stat --cached origin/master

    git status
    Above will show you if there were any changes made


    git status is very useful

    for example, it might show you

    On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
