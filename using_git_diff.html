    git diff is very useful. It can show you the differences between files.
    After adding some text to README.md, I did the following.
    git diff README.md
    diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
    index 6d28420..fec49a6 100644
    --- a/README.md
    +++ b/README.md
    @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@

    +Repository just for testing git features. Hopefully this is useful

    and inside main repository, if I don't know file name, I could just do.
    git diff
    and it could give back
    diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
    index 6d28420..fec49a6 100644
