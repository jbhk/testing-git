    Common git commands I use:
    0. git clone - get code from a repository for the first time
    1. git pull - get code from a repository
    2. git add .
       git commit -m "message"
       or
       git commit -a -m "message"
    3. Then type
       git push
       And then type your login to github

    miscellaneous
    Show diff between what you have changed and what is on origin and your master branch
    git diff --stat --cached origin/master

    git status
    Above will show you if there were any changes made


    git status is very useful

    for example, it might show you

    On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   blank
	modified:   common_git_commands.html


after doing

git commit -m "add more git info"
you might get
[master 8ec3b1e] add more git info
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 blank


 and if you do a git status after git -m commit "something"
you might get

 git commit -m "more git adding"
 [master bf29bed] more git adding
  1 file changed, 8 insertions(+)
 justin@justin-swivel:~/Documents/testing_github/testing-git$ git status
 On branch master
 Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

 nothing to commit, working tree clean
